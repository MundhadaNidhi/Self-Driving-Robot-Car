# Self-Driving-Robot-Car
Self-driving cars are automobiles that do not require human operation to navigate to a
destination. There are several advantages claimed about driverless vehicles, though they are
still being proven out. A few advantages brought forth are safer streets, greater environmental
benefits and better access for people with disabilities. They use cameras, sensors, and
advanced software to interpret and respond to traffic, pedestrians, and other surroundings on
the road. To qualify as fully autonomous, a vehicle must be able to navigate without human
intervention to a predetermined destination over roads that have not been adapted for its use.
In this project, the design of Self Driving Robot Car has been implemented. This Robot Car
will be designed so as to detect the lane lines. Along with the detection of lane lines, stop
signs, traffic lights and Obstacle detection will be accomplished
